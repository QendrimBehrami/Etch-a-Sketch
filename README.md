# Etch-a-Sketch
Implementation of a simple sketchpad \

## Additional Notes
The current implementation creates a div for each row and then a div for each cell within the row. 
The rows are likely not required, but it works nicely this way and so I decided not to change it.
Also I decided to try input fields instead of buttons/alerts and I also like that more.
